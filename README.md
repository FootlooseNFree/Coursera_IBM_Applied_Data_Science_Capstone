# :rocket: IBM Data Science Professional Certificate - Applied Data Science Capstone
This final course of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) program offered on Coursera requires implementation of all the knowledge gained throughout the program.\
The goal of this Capstone is to use data science methodology in solving a problem to identify factors that affect the launch outcomes of reusable rockets. The publicly available data from SpaceX is to be used as the source to perform the analysis.

The following key steps were performed to complete the project:
### :page_with_curl: Data Collection
Data was gathered using the open source SpaceX API and Wikipedia page of Falcon 9 launches
### :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Data Wrangling
The data was cleaned and processed to eliminate null values and potential biases by standardizing it.\
Target variable was identified and converted into dummy.
### :bar_chart: Exploratory Data Analysis
An exploratory data analysis was performed first with visualization and then using SQL to identify the relationships between various features.
### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Interactive Visualization
Further interactive visualizations were created to investigate geographical locations for the launc sites, as well as to gain quick insights on the launch success at each site.
### :computer: Machine Learning Prediction (Classification)
Four classification models were tested, evaluated and compared to find the best suitable candidate.
